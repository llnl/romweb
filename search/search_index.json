The related tutorial YouTube video can be found here . The example parameterizes the righthand side with frequency variable, $\\kappa$: $$f = \\cases{ \\displaystyle \\sin(\\kappa (x_0+x_1+x_2)) & for 3D \\cr \\displaystyle \\sin(\\kappa (x_0+x_1)) & for 2D }$$ The 2D solution contour plot for $\\kappa=\\pi$ is shown in the figure on the right to show the effect of $\\kappa$. For demonstration, we sample solutions at $\\kappa=\\pi$, $1.1\\pi$, and $1.2\\pi$. Then a ROM is build with basis size of 3, which is used to predict the solution for $\\kappa = 1.15\\pi$. The ROM is able to achieve a speedup of $7.5$ with a relative error of $6.4\\times10^{-4}$. One can follow the command line options below to reproduce the numerical results summarized in the table below: offline1 : poisson_global_rom -offline -f 1.0 -id 0 offline2 : poisson_global_rom -offline -f 1.1 -id 1 offline3 : poisson_global_rom -offline -f 1.2 -id 2 merge : poisson_global_rom -merge -ns 3 reference FOM solution : poisson_global_rom -fom -f 1.15 online : poisson_global_rom -online -f 1.15 The command line option -f defines a frequency $\\nu$ of the sinusoidal right hand side function.

The poisson_global_rom.cpp is based on ex1p.cpp from MFEM with a modification on the right hand side function. Greedy pROM for Poisson problem This example code demonstrates physics-informed greedy sampling procedure of building local pROMs for the Poisson problem. $$-\\Delta u = f$$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The example parameterizes the righthand side with frequency variable, $\\kappa$: $$f = \\cases{ \\displaystyle \\sin(\\kappa (x_0+x_1+x_2)) & for 3D \\cr \\displaystyle \\sin(\\kappa (x_0+x_1)) & for 2D }$$ A set of local ROMs are built for chosen parameter sample points. The parameter sample points are chosen through physics-informed greedy procedure, which is explained in detail by the tutorial YouTube video . Then the local ROMs are interpolated to build a tailored local ROM for a predictive case. Unlike the global ROM, the interpolated ROM has dimension that is the same as the individual local ROM. For example, one can follow the command line options below to reproduce the numerical results summarized in the table below: greedy step : poisson_local_rom_greedy -build_database -greedy-param-min 0.5 -greedy-param-max 3.0 -greedy-param-size 15 -greedysubsize 4 -greedyconvsize 6 -greedyrelerrortol 0.01 --mesh \"../../../dependencies/mfem/data/square-disc-nurbs.mesh\" This particular greedy step generates local pROMs at the following 8 parameter points, i.e., 0.521923, 0.743108, 1.322449, 1.754950, 2.011140, 2.281129, 2.587821, 2.950198. reference FOM solution : poisson_local_rom_greedy -fom --mesh \"../../../dependencies/mfem/data/square-disc-nurbs.mesh\" -f X.XX online : poisson_local_rom_greedy -use_database -online --mesh \"../../../dependencies/mfem/data/square-disc-nurbs.mesh\" -f X.XX You can replace X.XX with any value between 0.5 and 3.0.

The poisson_local_rom_greedy.cpp is based on ex1p.cpp from MFEM with a modification on the right hand side function. Global pROM for elliptic eigenproblem This example code demonstrates the use of libROM and MFEM to define a reduced order model for a finite element discretization of the eigenvalue problem $$-\\text{div}(\\kappa u) = \\lambda u$$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The example parameterizes the diffusion operator on the left hand side with the amplitude, $\\alpha$: $$\\kappa(x) = \\cases{ \\displaystyle 1 + \\alpha & for $\\vert x_1 \\vert < 0.25$ and $\\vert x_2 \\vert < 0.25$ \\cr \\displaystyle 1 & otherwise }$$ The 2D solution contour plot for $\\alpha=0.5$ is shown in the figure on the right to show the effect of $\\alpha$. For demonstration, we sample solutions at $\\alpha=0$ and $1$. Then a ROM is build with basis size of 20, which is used to predict the solution for $\\alpha = 0.5$. The ROM is able to achieve a speedup of $375$ with a relative error of $6.7\\times10^{-5}$ in the first eigenvalue and $2.4 \\times 10^{-3}$ in the first eigenvector. One can follow the command line options below to reproduce the numerical results summarized in the table below: offline1 : elliptic_eigenproblem_global_rom -offline -p 2 -rs 2 -id 0 -a 0 -n 4 offline2 : elliptic_eigenproblem_global_rom -offline -p 2 -rs 2 -id 1 -a 1 -n 4 merge : elliptic_eigenproblem_global_rom -p 2 -rs 2 -ns 2 -n 4 reference FOM solution : elliptic_eigenproblem_global_rom -fom -p 2 -rs 2 -a 0.5 -n 4 online : elliptic_eigenproblem_global_rom -online -p 2 -rs 2 -a 0.5 -ef 1.0 -n 4 The command line option -a defines the amplitude of the conductivity $\\alpha$ in the contrast region of the diffusion operator on left hand side. The table below shows the performance result for the testing case -a 0.5 . FOM solution time ROM solution time Speed-up First eigenvalue relative error First eigenvector relative error 1.2e-1 sec 3.2e-4 sec 375 6.7e-5 2.4e-3 The code that generates the numerical results above can be found in ( elliptic_eigenproblem_global_rom.cpp ). The elliptic_eigenproblem_global_rom.cpp is based on ex11p.cpp from MFEM with a modification on the differential operator on the left hand side. DMD for heat conduction For a given initial condition, i.e., $u_0(x) = u(0,x)$, heat conduction solves a simple 2D/3D time dependent nonlinear heat conduction problem $$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\nabla\\cdot (\\kappa + \\alpha u)\\nabla u,$$ with a natural insulating boundary condition $\\frac{du}{dn}=0$. We linearize the problem by using the temperature field $u$ from the previous time step to compute the conductivity coefficient. One can run the following command line options to reproduce the DMD results summarized in the table below: heat_conduction -s 3 -a 0.5 -k 0.5 -o 4 -tf 0.7 -vs 1 -visit FOM solution time DMD setup time DMD query time DMD relative error 4.8 sec 0.34 sec 1.4e-3 sec 8.2e-4 The code that generates the numerical results above can be found in ( heat_conduction.cpp ). The heat_conduction.cpp is based on ex16p.cpp from MFEM. Parametric DMD for heat conduction This example demonstrates the parametric DMD on the heat conduction problem . The initial condition, $u_0(x)$, is parameterized by the center of circle and the radius, i.e., $$u_0(x) = \\cases{ \\displaystyle 2 & for $|x-c| < r$ \\cr \\displaystyle 1 & for $|x-c| \\ge r$ }$$ One can run the following command line options to reproduce the parametric DMD results summarized in the table below: rm -rf parameters.txt parametric_heat_conduction -r 0.1 -cx 0.1 -cy 0.1 -o 4 -visit -offline -rdim 16 parametric_heat_conduction -r 0.1 -cx 0.1 -cy 0.5 -o 4 -visit -offline -rdim 16 parametric_heat_conduction -r 0.1 -cx 0.5 -cy 0.1 -o 4 -visit -offline -rdim 16 parametric_heat_conduction -r 0.1 -cx 0.5 -cy 0.5 -o 4 -visit -offline -rdim 16 parametric_heat_conduction -r 0.5 -cx 0.1 -cy 0.1 -o 4 -visit -offline -rdim 16 parametric_heat_conduction -r 0.25 -cx 0.2 -cy 0.4 -o 4 -visit -online -predict parametric_heat_conduction -r 0.4 -cx 0.2 -cy 0.3 -o 4 -visit -online -predict where r, cx, and cy specify the radius, the x and y coordinates of circular initial conditions. r cx cy FOM solution time DMD setup time DMD query time DMD relative error 0.25 0.2 0.4 13.3 sec 0.34 sec 1.2 sec 7.0e-3 0.2 0.4 0.2 13.8 sec 0.32 sec 1.2 sec 3.9e-3 0.3 0.3 0.3 13.6 sec 0.33 sec 1.1 sec 1.3e-2 0.3 0.4 0.2 14.1 sec 0.34 sec 1.3 sec 8.4e-3 0.2 0.3 0.4 14.2 sec 0.34 sec 1.3 sec 7.9e-3 0.4 0.2 0.3 13.9 sec 0.36 sec 1.5 sec 9.0e-3 The code that generates the numerical results above can be found in ( parametric_heat_conduction.cpp ). The parametric_heat_conduction.cpp is based on ex16p.cpp from MFEM. Optimal control for heat conduction with DMD and differential evolution This example demonstrates the optimal control heat conduction problem with greedy parametric DMD and differential evolution. The initial condition, $u_0(x)$, is parameterized by the center of circle and the radius, i.e., $$u_0(x) = \\cases{ \\displaystyle 2 & for $|x-c| < r$ \\cr \\displaystyle 1 & for $|x-c| \\ge r$ }$$ The goal of the optimal control problem is to find an initial condition that achieves the target last time step temperature distribution. If it does not achieve the target, then it should be closest, given the initial condition parameterization. It is formulated mathematically as an optimization problem: $$ \\underset{c,r}{minimize} \\ || u_T(c,r) - u_{target} ||_2^2,$$ where $u_T$ denotes the last time step temperature and $u_{target}$ denotes the target temperature. Note that $u_T$ depends on the initial condition parameters, i.e., $c$ and $r$. It means that we obtain $u_T$ by solving a forward heat conduction problem. As you can imagine, it needs to explore the parameter space and try to find $c$ and $r$ that produces $u_T$ that best matches $u_{target}$. If each solution process of heat conduction problem is computationally expensive, the search for the optimal parameter can take a while. Therefore, we use our parametric DMD to expedite the process and the search algorithm is done by the differential evolution . Here are the steps to solve the optimal control problem. First, you must delete any post-processed files from the previous differential evolution run. For example, rm -rf parameters.txt rm -rf de_parametric_heat_conduction_greedy_* Then create parametric DMD using a greedy approach with physics-informed error indicator: de_parametric_heat_conduction_greedy -build_database -rdim 16 -greedy-param-size 20 -greedysubsize 10 -greedyconvsize 15 -greedyreldifftol 0.0001 Then you can generate target temperature field with a specific $r$ and $c$ values. Here we used $r=0.2$, $cx=0.2$, and $cy=0.2$ to generate a target temperature field. The target temperature field is shown in the picture above (the one on the left). Therefore, if DMD is good enough, the differential evolution should be able to find $c$ and $r$ values that are closed to these: de_parametric_heat_conduction_greedy -r 0.2 -cx 0.2 -cy 0.2 -visit (Compute target FOM) where r, cx, and cy specify the radius, the x and y coordinates of circular initial conditions.

The DMD temperature field at the last time step on this control parameters is shown in the picture above (the one on the right).

DMDc for heat conduction For a given initial condition, i.e., $u_0(x) = u(0,x)$, heat conduction_dmdc solves a simple 2D time dependent nonlinear heat conduction problem $$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\nabla\\cdot (\\kappa + \\alpha u)\\nabla u + f,$$ with a natural insulating boundary condition $\\frac{du}{dn}=0$ and an external inlet-outlet source $$ f(x,t) = A_{+}(t) \\exp\\left(\\dfrac{-| x - x_{+} |^2}{2}\\right) - A_{-}(t) \\exp\\left(\\dfrac{-| x - x_{-} |^2}{2}\\right)), $$ where the source locations are $x_+ = (0, 0)$ and $x_- = (0.5, 0.5)$. The amplitude $A_+$ and $A_-$ are regarded as control variables. We linearize the problem by using the temperature field $u$ from the previous time step to compute the conductivity coefficient.

We choose velocity function so that the dynamics form a spiral advection. One can run the following command line options to reproduce the DMD results summarized in the table below: dg_advection -p 3 -rp 1 -dt 0.005 -tf 4 FOM solution time DMD setup time DMD query time DMD relative error 5.2 sec 30.6 sec 1.9e-2 sec 1.9e-4 The code that generates the numerical results above can be found in ( dg_advection.cpp ). The dg_advection.cpp is based on ex9p.cpp from MFEM. Optimal control for advection with DMD and differential evolution This example demonstrates optimal control for advection with the greedy parametric DMD and differential evolution. The initial condition, $u_0(x)$, is parameterized by the wavenumber $f$, so that $$ u_0(x,y) = \\sin(f \\cdot x) sin(f \\cdot y). $$ The goal of the optimal control problem is to find an initial condition that achieves the target last time step solution. If it does not achieve the target, then it should be closest, given the initial condition parameterization. It is formulated mathematically as an optimization problem: $$ \\underset{f}{minimize} \\ || u_T(f) - u_{target} ||_2^2,$$ where $u_T$ denotes the last time step solution and $u_{target}$ denotes the target solution. Note that $u_T$ depends on the initial condition parameter, $f$. It means that we obtain $u_T$ by solving a forward advection problem. In order to do so, it must explore the parameter space and try to find the $f$ that produces a $u_T$ that best matches $u_{target}$. If each advection simulation is computationally expensive, the search for the optimal parameter can take a very long time. Therefore, we use our parametric DMD to expedite the process and the search algorithm is done by differential evolution . Here are the steps to solve the optimal control problem. First, create a directory within which you will run the example, such as mkdir de_advection_greedy && cd de_advection_greedy Then create the parametric DMD using a greedy approach with a physics-informed error indicator: mpirun -n 8 ../de_dg_advection_greedy -p 3 -rp 1 -dt 0.005 -tf 1.0 -build_database -rdim 16 -greedyreldifftol 0.00000001 -greedy-param-f-factor-max 2. -greedy-param-f-factor-min 1. -greedy-param-size 20 -greedysubsize 5 -greedyconvsize 8 Now, generate the target solution with a specific $f$. Here we use $f = 1.6$. mpirun -n 8 ../de_dg_advection_greedy -p 3 -rp 1 -dt 0.005 -tf 1.0 -run_dmd -ff 1.6 -visit Finally, run the differential evolution using the parametric DMD as: srun -n8 -ppdebug greedy_advection -p 3 -rp 1 -dt 0.005 -tf 1.0 -de -ff 1.6 -de_min_ff 1.0 -de_max_ff 2.0 -de_f 0.9 -de_cr 0.9 -de_ps 50 -de_min_iter 1 -de_max_iter 100 -de_ct 0.001 The differential evolution should be able to find the following optimal control parameters, e.g., in Quartz: $f = 1.597618121565086$, which is very close to the true parameter that was used to generate the targer solution. The images above show the the target solution on the left, and the DMD solution at the differential evolution optimal parameter on the right. The code that generates the numerical results above can be found in ( de_dg_advection_greedy.cpp ). The de_dg_advection_greedy.cpp is based on ex9p.cpp from MFEM. Global pROM for advection For a given initial condition, i.e., $u_0(x) = u(0,x)$, DG advection solves the time-dependent advection problem: $$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + v\\cdot\\nabla u = 0,$$ where $v$ is a given advection velocity.

Local pROM for advection For a given initial condition, i.e., $u_0(x) = u(0,x)$, DG advection solves the time-dependent advection problem: $$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + v\\cdot\\nabla u = 0,$$ where $v$ is a given advection velocity. We choose velocity function so that the dynamics form a spiral advection. This example illustrates how a parametric pROM can be built through local ROM interpolation techniques. The following sequence of command lines will let you build such a parametric pROM, where the frequency of sinusoidal initial condition function is used as a parameter (its value is passed by a user through -ff command line option). Two local pROMs are constructed through -offline option with parameter values of 1.02 and 1.08, then the local pROM operators are interpolated to build a tailored local pROM at the frequency value of 1.05. Unlike the global ROM, the interpolated pROM has dimension that is the same as the individual pROM, i.e., 40 for this particular problem. rm -rf frequencies.txt dg_advection_local_rom_matrix_interp --mesh \"../data/periodic-square.mesh\" -offline -rs 4 -ff 1.02 dg_advection_local_rom_matrix_interp --mesh \"../data/periodic-square.mesh\" -interp_prep -rs 4 -ff 1.02 -rdim 40 dg_advection_local_rom_matrix_interp --mesh \"../data/periodic-square.mesh\" -offline -rs 4 -ff 1.08 dg_advection_local_rom_matrix_interp --mesh \"../data/periodic-square.mesh\" -interp_prep -rs 4 -ff 1.08 -rdim 40 dg_advection_local_rom_matrix_interp --mesh \"../data/periodic-square.mesh\" -fom -rs 4 -ff 1.05 -visit dg_advection_local_rom_matrix_interp --mesh \"../data/periodic-square.mesh\" -online_interp -rs 4 -ff 1.05 -rdim 40 FOM solution time pROM solution time pROM speed-up pROM relative error 39.38 sec 0.63 sec 62.5 1.19e-2 The code that generates the numerical results above can be found in ( dg_advection_local_rom_matrix_interp.cpp ).

Global pROM for Grad-div Problem This example code demonstrates the use of libROM and MFEM to define a reduced order model for a simple 2D/3D $H (\\text{div})$ diffusion problem corresponding to the second order definite equation $$- {\\rm grad} (\\alpha\\ {\\rm div} (F)) + \\beta F = f$$ with boundary condition $F \\cdot n = $ \"given normal field.\" The right-hand side $f$ is first calculated from the given exact solution $F$. We then try to reconstruct the true solution $F$ assuming only the right-hand side function $f$ is known. In 2D, the exact solution $F$ is defined as $$ F(x,y) = (\\cos(\\kappa x) \\sin(\\kappa y), \\cos(\\kappa y) \\sin(\\kappa x)) $$ where $\\kappa$ is a parameter controlling the frequency. The 2D solution contour plot for $\\kappa=1.15 \\pi$ is shown in the figure on the right to show the effect of $\\kappa$. For demonstration, we sample solutions at $\\kappa=\\pi$, $1.05\\pi$, $1.1 \\pi$, $1.2 \\pi$, $1.25\\pi$ and $1.3\\pi$. Then a ROM is built with basis size of 6, which is used to predict the solution for $\\kappa = 1.15\\pi$.

Global pROM for linear elasticity This example demonstrates how to apply projection-based ROM to a linear elasticity problem. The linear elasticity problem describes a multi-material cantilever beam. Specifically, the following weak form is solved: $$-\\text{div}(\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{u})) = 0$$ where $$\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{u}) = \\lambda \\text{div}(\\boldsymbol{u}) \\boldsymbol{I} + \\mu (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} + \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}^T)$$ is the stress tensor corresponding to displacement field $\\boldsymbol{u}$, and $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the material Lame constants. The Lame constants are related to Young's modulus ($E$) and Poisson's ratio ($\\nu$) as $$\\lambda = \\frac{E\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}$$ $$\\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$$ The boundary condition are $\\boldsymbol{u}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ on the fixed part of the boundary with attribute 1, and $\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{u})\\cdot n = f$ on the remainder with f being a constant pull down vector on boundary elements with attribute 2, and zero otherwise. The geometry of the domain is assumed to be as follows: Three distinct steps are required, i.e., offline, merge, and online steps, to build global ROM for the linear elasticity problem.

Global pROM for Lagrangian hydrodynamics Laghos (LAGrangian High-Order Solver) is a miniapp that solves the time-dependent Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics in a moving Lagrangian frame using unstructured high-order finite element spatial discretization and explicit high-order time-stepping. LaghosROM introduces reduced order models of Laghos simulations. A list of example problems that you can solve with LaghosROM includes Sedov blast, Gresho vortex, Taylor-Green vortex, triple-point, and Rayleigh-Taylor instability problems. Below are command line options for each problems and some numerical results. For each problem, four different phases need to be taken, i.e., the offline, hyper-reduction preprocessing, online, and restore phase. The online phase runs necessary full order model (FOM) to generate simulation data. libROM dynamically collects the data as the FOM simulation marches in time domain. In the hyper-reduction preprocessing phase, the libROM builds a library of reduced basis as well as hyper-reduction operators. The online phase runs the ROM and the restore phase projects the ROM solutions to the full order model dimension. Sedov blast problem Sedov blast problem is a three-dimensional standard shock hydrodynamic benchmark test. An initial delta source of internal energy deposited at the origin of a three-dimensional cube is considered. The computational domain is the unit cube $\\tilde{\\Omega} = [0,1]^3$ with wall boundary conditions on all surfaces, i.e., $v\\cdot n = 0$. The initial velocity is given by $v=0$. The initial density is given by $\\rho = 1$. The initial energy is given by a delta function at the origin. The adiabatic index in the ideal gas equations of state is set $\\gamma = 1.4$. The initial mesh is a uniform Catesian hexahedral mesh, which deforms over time. It can be seen that the radial symmetry is maintained in the shock wave propagation in both FOM and pROM simulations.

In 2D, we define $\\mathbf{E}$ as $$\\mathbf{E} = (\\sin ( \\kappa x_2 ), \\sin ( \\kappa x_1 ) )^\\top, $$ and in 3D we define $$\\mathbf{E} = (\\sin ( \\kappa x_2 ), \\sin ( \\kappa x_3 ), \\sin ( \\kappa x_1 ) )^\\top. $$ Here, $\\kappa$ is a parameter which controls the frequency of the sine wave. The 2D solution contour plot for $\\kappa= 1.15$ is shown in the figure on the right. For demonstration, we sample solutions at $\\kappa=1\\pi$, $1.1\\pi$, and $1.2\\pi$. We then build the ROM with a basis size of 3, which we use to predict the solution for $\\kappa = 1.15$.

If it does not achieve the target, then it should be closest, given the initial condition parameterization. It is formulated mathematically as an optimization problem: $$ \\underset{c,r}{minimize} \\ || u_T(c,r) - u_{target} ||_2^2,$$ where $u_T$ denotes the last time step temperature and $u_{target}$ denotes the target temperature. Note that $u_T$ depends on the initial condition parameters, i.e., $c$ and $r$. It means that we obtain $u_T$ by solving a forward heat conduction problem. As you can imagine, it needs to explore the parameter space and try to find $c$ and $r$ that produces $u_T$ that best matches $u_{target}$. If each solution process of heat conduction problem is computationally expensive, the search for the optimal parameter can take a while. Therefore, we use our parametric DMD to expedite the process and the search algorithm is done by the differential evolution . Here are the steps to solve the optimal control problem. First, you must delete any post-processed files from the previous differential evolution run. For example, rm -rf parameters.txt rm -rf de_parametric_heat_conduction_greedy_* Then create parametric DMD using a greedy approach with physics-informed error indicator: de_parametric_heat_conduction_greedy -build_database -rdim 16 -greedy-param-size 20 -greedysubsize 10 -greedyconvsize 15 -greedyreldifftol 0.0001 Then you can generate target temperature field with a specific $r$ and $c$ values. Here we used $r=0.2$, $cx=0.2$, and $cy=0.2$ to generate a target temperature field. The target temperature field is shown in the picture above (the one on the left). Therefore, if DMD is good enough, the differential evolution should be able to find $c$ and $r$ values that are closed to these: de_parametric_heat_conduction_greedy -r 0.2 -cx 0.2 -cy 0.2 -visit (Compute target FOM) where r, cx, and cy specify the radius, the x and y coordinates of circular initial conditions.

Proper orthogonal decomposition One of the core features in libROM is the ability to extract important modes from given physical simulation data. The proper othogonal decomposition (POD) is a popular method for compressing physical simulation data to obtain optimal \"reduced\" bases in the following sense: $$\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} =\\underset{\\boldsymbol{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times r}, \\boldsymbol{A}^T\\boldsymbol{A} = \\boldsymbol{I}_{r\\times r} }{\\arg\\min} || \\boldsymbol{U} - \\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{A}^T\\boldsymbol{U} ||_F^2, $$ where $\\boldsymbol{U}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$ is simulation data and $\\boldsymbol{I}_{r\\times r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r\\times r}$ denotes an identity matrix. That is, the POD tries to find the orthogonal matrix, $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$, whose span minimizes the projection error in the Frobenius norm. The POD modes can be obtained in two equivalent ways: (i) eigenvalue decomposition and (ii) singular value decomposition (SVD). We take the latter approach, i.e., let's say the thin SVD of $\\boldsymbol{U}$ is given by $$\\boldsymbol{U} = \\boldsymbol{W\\Sigma V}^T.$$ Then the solution of the POD is given by taking the first $r$ columns of the left singular matrix, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} = [\\boldsymbol{w}_{1},\\ldots ,\\boldsymbol{w}_r]$, where $\\boldsymbol{w}_k$ is $k$th left singular vector, assuming that the singular value is written in the decreasing order. Efficient data collection High-fidelity physical simulations generate intensive data in its size, which makes the data collection process daunting. Therefore, the libROM aims to ease the difficulty associated with the intensive data size. The libROM can be directly integrated to the physics solver that generates the intensive simulation data. For example, if the physical simulation is time dependent, then each time step solution data can be feed into the libROM incrementally so that the singular value decomposition is efficiently updated in parallel. This approach is incremental SVD . There are other types of SVDs which exploits efficiency. The libROM provides following four SVDs: Static SVD incremental SVD randomized SVD space-time SVD Static SVD The static SVD waits the libROM to collect all the simulation data. Once the snapshot matrix $\\boldsymbol{U}$ is formed, then the SVD is performed. Therefore, if the data size is big, this approach is not efficient and not recommended. However, because it gives the most accurate SVD results, it is ideal for a small problem. Incremental SVD Unlike the static SVD, the incremental SVD does not wait. Instead, as the data comes in, the SVD is performed right away. Because the incremental SVD only needs to find out the effect of one additional simulation data vector to the previous SVD, the update can be done very efficiently without requiring much memory. Therefore, it is useful for large-scale problems. For the detailed explanation about the incremental SVD, we refer to the following journal papers: M. Brand, Incremental singular value decomposition of uncertain data with missing values , In European Conference on Computer Vision , p707-720, 2002 G. Oxberry, T. Kostova-Vassilevska, W. Arrighi, K. Chand, Limited-memory adaptive snapshot selection for proper orthogonal decomposition , International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering , 109(2), p198-217, 2016 H. Fareed, J.R. Singler, Error Analysis of an Incremental Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Algorithm for PDE Simulation Data , Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics , 368, 112525, 2020 Randomized SVD Randomization can bring computational efficiency in computing SVDs. For example, consider that one needs to extract $p$ dominant modes from $n \\times m$ tall dense matrix, using SVD. The randomized SVD requires $\\mathcal{O}(nm\\log(p))$ floating-point operations, while the static SVD algorithm requires $\\mathcal{O}(nmp)$ flops. The randomized SVD that is implemented in libROM can be found in the following journal paper: N. Halko, P.G. Martinsson, J.A. Tropp, Finding structure with randomness: Probabilistic algorithms for constructing approximate matrix decompositions . SIAM review , 53(2), p217-288, 2011 Space-time SVD For time dependent problems, one can reduce not only the spatial degrees of freedom, but also the temporal degrees of freedom by representing the space-time solution as a linear combination of a space-time reduced basis. The space-time reduced basis can be mathematically written as a Kronecker product of temporal and spatial bases. Fortunately, one can extract temporal as well as spatial reduced bases from one single SVD. The procedure is schematically depicted in the figure below: For the detailed explanation about the incremental SVD, we refer to the following three journal papers: Y. Kim, K. Wang, Y. Choi, Efficient space\u2013time reduced order model for linear dynamical systems in Python using less than 120 lines of code . Mathematics , 9(14), 1690, 2021 Y. Choi, P. Brown, W. Arrighi, R. Anderson, K. Huynh, Space\u2013time reduced order model for large-scale linear dynamical systems with application to boltzmann transport problems . Journal of Computational Physics , 424, 109845, 2021 Y. Choi, K. Carlberg, Space-time least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection for nonlinear model reduction , SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing , 41(1), A26-A58, 2019 Dynamic Mode Decomposition The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) provides a great way of finding an approximate locally linear dynamical system, $$ \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{u}}{dt} = \\mathcal{A}\\boldsymbol{u},$$ for a given nonlinear dynamical system, $$ \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{u}}{dt} = \\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{u},t;\\boldsymbol{\\mu}),$$ with initial condition, $\\boldsymbol{u}_0$. It takes non-intrusive approach, i.e., equation-free method, so it is applicable even if there is only data, but no $\\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{u},t;\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$. For example, let's say the discrete-time data are given as: $$\\boldsymbol{U} = [\\boldsymbol{u}_1,\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{u}_m],$$ where $\\boldsymbol{u}_k\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ denotes solution at $t=k\\Delta t$. The DMD is trying to find the best $\\boldsymbol{A}$ such that $$\\boldsymbol{U}^+ = \\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{U}^-,$$ where $\\boldsymbol{U}^+ = [\\boldsymbol{u}_2,\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{u}_m]$ and $\\boldsymbol{U}^- = [\\boldsymbol{u}_1, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{u}_{m-1}]$. The following procedure is taken to find the best $\\boldsymbol{A}$. Take the singular value decomposition (SVD) of $\\boldsymbol{U}^-$ $$\\boldsymbol{U}^- \\approx \\boldsymbol{W}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{V}^*,$$ where $*$ denotes the conjugate transpose, $\\boldsymbol{W}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{n\\times r}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{r\\times r}$, $\\boldsymbol{V}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{m\\times r}$, and $r \\leq m$. Because $\\boldsymbol{U}^+ = \\boldsymbol{A}\\boldsymbol{U}^-$, using the pseudo-inverse of the approximate $\\boldsymbol{U}^-$, we have $$\\boldsymbol{A} \\approx \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}} = \\boldsymbol{U}^+\\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{W}^*$$ It is easier to deal with the reduced operator $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}_r$, which relates the discrete-time dynamic of reduced states: $$\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}_{k+1} = \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}_r\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}_k,$$ where $\\boldsymbol{u}_k = \\boldsymbol{W} \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}_k$ and $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}_r$ is defined as $$\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}_r=\\boldsymbol{W}^*\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}\\boldsymbol{W}$$ $$\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}_r=\\boldsymbol{W}^*\\boldsymbol{U}^+\\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^{-1}$$ Let the eigen-decomposition of $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}_r$ to be $$\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}_r \\boldsymbol{X} = \\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$$ and set either $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} = \\boldsymbol{W}\\boldsymbol{X}$ or $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} = \\boldsymbol{U}^+ \\boldsymbol{V} \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{X}$, then the DMD solution at time, $t$, can be found as $$\\boldsymbol{u}(t) = \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}^{t/\\Delta t} \\boldsymbol{b}_0,$$ where $\\boldsymbol{b}_0 = \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^\\dagger \\boldsymbol{u}_0$. For the detailed explanation about the DMD, we refer to the following book: J.N. Kutz, S.L. Brunton, B.W. Brunton, J.L. Proctor, Dynamic mode decomposition: data-driven modeling of complex systems . Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics , 2016 Projection-based reduced order model In contrast to the DMD, the projection-based reduced order model (pROM) takes an intrusive approach, that is, it is NOT equation-free. The pROM first represents the solution as a linear combincation of reduced basis. The reduced basis can be obtained by the POD, for example. Let's denote the reduced basis as $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times r}$ and express the solution, $\\boldsymbol{u}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ as $$\\boldsymbol{u} = \\boldsymbol{u}_{\\text{ref}}+\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}},$$ where $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^r$ denotes the generalized coordinates with respect to the reduced basis. Then we substitute $\\boldsymbol{u}$ in the governing equation, say a nonlinear dynamical system governed by the following ordinary differential equations, $$\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{u}}{dt} = \\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{u},t;\\boldsymbol{\\mu}),$$ to obtain the over-determined system, i.e., $$\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\frac{d\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}}}{dt} = \\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{\\text{ref}}+\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}},t;\\boldsymbol{\\mu}),$$ which has more equations than unknowns. Therefore, the system needs to be closed by a projection. Galerkin and Petrov-Galerking projections are popular. For example, the Galerkin projection multiplies both sides by $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^T$ and the system of equations become $$\\frac{d\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}}}{dt} = \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^T \\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{\\text{ref}}+\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{u}},t;\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$$ By the way, the nonlinear term $\\boldsymbol{f}$ still scales with the full order model size and it needs to be updated every time its argument changes due to Newton step updates, for example. The hyper-reduction provides an efficient way of computing nonlinear terms by sampling an important subset. By the way, if $\\boldsymbol{f}$ is linear, then $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^T\\boldsymbol{f}$ can be pre-computed, so the hyper-reduction is not necessary. Hyper-reduction Hyper-reduction is essential to reduce the complexity of nonlinear terms in pROM. The most popular hyper-reduction technique is the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The DEIM approximates the nonlinear term with a gappy POD, i.e., it expresses the nonlinear term with a linear combination of the nonlinear term reduced basis, $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{f}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times f}$: $$\\boldsymbol{f} \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_f \\hat{\\boldsymbol{f}},$$ where $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{f}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{f}$ is a generalized coordinate for the nonlinear term. The usual data for the nonlinear term basis, $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{f}$ is snapshot of nonlinear term itself. Alternatively, it can be replaced by the solution basis (i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$ or slight modification of it) via the SNS method introduced in the following journal paper: Y. Choi, D. Coombs, R. Anderson, SNS: a solution-based nonlinear subspace method for time-dependent model order reduction . SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing , 42(2), A1116\u2013A1146, 2020 Then, we introduce a sampling matrix (in order words, a collocation matrix), $\\boldsymbol{Z}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times z}$, which selects a subset of the nonliear term, $\\boldsymbol{F}$. That is, each column of $\\boldsymbol{Z}$ is a column of the identity matrix, $\\boldsymbol{I} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$. Combining the collocation matrix and the nonlinear basis, we solve the following least-squares problem to solve for the generalized coordinate, $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{f}}$: $$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{f}} = \\underset{\\boldsymbol{y}\\in{\\mathbb{R}^{f}}}{\\arg\\min} \\hspace{3pt} || \\boldsymbol{Z}^T\\boldsymbol{f} - \\boldsymbol{Z}^T\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_f \\boldsymbol{y} ||_2^2$$ The solution to the least-squares problem is known to be $$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{f}} = (\\boldsymbol{Z}^T\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{f})^\\dagger \\boldsymbol{Z}^T\\boldsymbol{f}.$$ Note that $(\\boldsymbol{Z}^T\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{f})^\\dagger$ can be pre-computed once the indices for $\\boldsymbol{Z}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_f$ are known. Note also that you do not need to construct $\\boldsymbol{Z}$. You only need to sample selected rows of $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_f$ and do the pseudo-inversion. This is what we do in libROM. Also note that we only need to evaluate a subset of $\\boldsymbol{f}$ because of $\\boldsymbol{Z}^T$ in front of $\\boldsymbol{f}$. Parametric ROMs Whether it is intrusive or non-intrusive ROM, if the ROM can only reproduce the full order model simulation data with high accuracy, it is useless because the full order model solution is already available. In order for any ROMs to be useful, they must be able to predict the solution which is not generated yet. We call such a ROM parametric because it is able to predict the solution for a new parameter value. Two extreme types of parametric ROMs are global and local ROMs. Global ROMs The global ROMs collect simulation data over several sampled points in a given parameter space and use all of them as a whole, building a global reduced basis. The size of the reduced basis becomes larger as the number of samples increases. Therefore, the global ROM is only effective when a small number of samples are used. Local ROMs A local ROM is built with the simulation data corresponding only to one specific sample. Usually, several local ROMs are built for several sample points and either interpolation or trust-region is used to predict the solution at points which were not sampled. Greedy sampling algorithm The greedy sampling algorithm is a physics-informed sampling strategy to build a parametric ROM . The parametric ROM can be used to predict the solution of a new parameter point that has not been seen in the training phase. The greey algorithms follow the general procedure below: Define a parameter space Pick an initial point in the parameter space to build a ROM there (a good cancidiate initla point is either the centroid or one of end points) Evaluate error indicator of the current ROM (either global or local ROM) at $N$ random points within the parameter space Check if the maximum error indicator value is less than the desirable accuracy threshold If the answer to Step 4 is yes, then terminate the greedy process. If the answer to Step 4 is no, then collect the full order model simulation data at the maximum error indicator point and add them to update the ROM Go to Step 3. The success of the greedy algorithm depends on the error indicator . The error indicator must satisfy the following two criteria: Its value must have positive correlation with the relative error measure The evaluation of the error indicator must be computationally efficient Note that the error indicator plays a role of a proxy for the accuracy of the ROM. The most popular error indicator is residual-based, which we recommend you to use for your physical simulations. The general framework of the greedy algorithm is implemented in libROM. The example of the libROM usage case can be found for the Poisson problem at poisson_greedy.cpp . The corresponding tutorial page can be found here . Several variants of the greedy procedure described above is possible. For more detailed explanation about the greedy algorithm, we refer to the following jounral paper, where the greedy algorithm is described for the interpolated ROM in a matrix manifold: Y. Choi, G.

Achieving an analogous capability in computational science is far more challenging due to the diversity of governing equations, geometries, physical regimes, and discretizations. libROM team addresses this challenge through the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM) \u2014 a general architectural framework that combines data-driven local modeling with classical finite-element-style global assembly. Importantly, DD-FEM is not a conceptual proposal: it has been realized in multiple production-quality algorithms , each demonstrated through published numerical examples. What Is a Foundation Model in Computational Science? In computational science, a foundation model must satisfy requirements beyond those in data-centric ML fields. In particular, it must: generalize across geometries, domains, and boundary conditions , be reusable without retraining for every new global configuration, enforce governing equations and physical constraints explicitly, scale to large systems using data from smaller subsystems, admit mathematical analysis (stability, error bounds, convergence). Inspiration from Classical Foundational Methods Our definition of a foundation model for computational science is intentionally inspired by classical foundation methods that have underpinned scientific computing for decades, most notably the finite element method (FEM) and the finite volume method (FVM) . These methods are considered foundational not because they solve a single problem optimally, but because they provide a general, reusable, and composable framework applicable across a broad range of governing equations, geometries, and physical regimes. FEM and FVM achieve this through: local representations that are independent of global problem size, systematic assembly into large-scale global systems, explicit enforcement of conservation laws and governing equations, extensibility across domains without redesigning the core methodology. In this sense, FEM and FVM already embody many of the characteristics now associated with \u201cfoundation models\u201d: generality, reusability, scalability, and scientific rigor. Our definition of foundation models for computational science builds directly on these principles. Rather than viewing foundation models as purely data-driven artifacts, we frame them as architectural frameworks that integrate learning into the same local-to-global, physics-constrained structure that has made FEM and FVM foundational to scientific computing. Challenges of Building Foundation Models in Computational Science Developing foundatin models in computational science is fundamentally harder than in natural language processing or vision. The Defining Foundation Models for Computational Science position paper [1] outlines several structural obstacles that must be addressed before truly general, reusable scientific foundation models can be achieved. Massive Data Point Size In NLP or computer vision, individual data points (tokens, image patches) are small and easily batched for training. In contrast, a single high-fidelity scientific simulation snapshot can contain millions to trillions of degrees of freedom. This: creates huge memory and compute burdens, limits batch sizes, slows convergence of training, and makes overfitting more likely with limited data. Expensive Fine-Tuning Across Tasks Foundation models should adapt to new tasks with minimal additional training. In computational science, however, downstream problems frequently differ in PDE type, geometry, mesh resolution, boundary conditions, or time-dependent behavior. Fine-tuning on such distinct tasks can be computationally expensive, undermining reusability and scalability. Data Heterogeneity Scientific systems involve a wide range of data types (scalars, vectors, tensors), multi-physics couplings, and time dependencies. Designing a single architecture that meaningfully integrates such heterogeneous data across domains is an open research challenge. Lack of Standardized Datasets Unlike NLP and vision, large standardized datasets covering multiple physics domains do not exist. The absence of shared, high-quality datasets hampers large-scale pretraining and makes it hard to benchmark and compare scientific foundation models. Mesh and Geometry Dependence Scientific simulations depend intrinsically on the computational mesh and domain geometry. Changes in mesh resolution, element type, topology, or geometry can invalidate naive generalization because many learned models are tied to a fixed discretization. Crucially, this dependence also forces expensive fine-tuning : as geometry or mesh changes, reuse of a monolithic model is often impossible, making large-scale retraining (or heavy fine-tuning) unavoidable. This breaks scalability and undermines the reusability expected of foundation models. Physics-Informed Constraints Scientific systems obey conservation laws, symmetries, and boundary conditions. Enforcing these constraints in learned models without degrading generality is a major open problem. Many ML models either ignore physical laws or hard-code specific physics, limiting flexibility. Trust, Interpretability, and Scientific Validity For adoption in engineering and science, models must be interpretable, verifiable, and physically consistent. Black-box neural models that violate conservation or produce nonphysical results are difficult to trust in high-stakes applications. Multiscale and Long-Time Behavior Real scientific systems often involve multiple spatial and temporal scales (e.g., turbulence, fracture, phase change). Capturing long-time dynamics and multi-scale interactions in a single model \u2014 especially without retraining \u2014 remains a critical open challenge. These challenges suggest that foundation models in computational science cannot be constructed as purely data-driven, end-to-end surrogates. Instead, they require an architectural framework that integrates learning with classical numerical structure, supports local training with global reuse, and preserves scientific rigor. The Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM) provides such a framework. The Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM) Core Principle DD-FEM replaces classical finite-element shape functions with learned local models trained on component-level data, while retaining: Local training on small subdomains or components Global assembly via domain decomposition or finite-element-style coupling Explicit solution of governing equations Reuse of pretrained components across unseen global systems This mirrors the role of basis functions in FEM, but with learned representations that can capture multiscale, nonlinear, and parameterized physics more efficiently. Implemented DD-FEM Realizations through libROM open source codes DD-FEM is a framework , not a single algorithm. libROM contains multiple, independently developed realizations that instantiate this framework in different settings. 1. ScaleUpROM: Projection-Based DD-FEM with DG Assembly ScaleUpROM is a DD-FEM realization using projection-based reduced order models coupled through discontinuous Galerkin domain decomposition (DG-DD) . Key characteristics: - Local ROMs trained only on small components - Global systems assembled without retraining - Robust spatial extrapolation (\u201ctrain small, model big\u201d) - Physics-constrained solves at all scales ScaleUpROM has been demonstrated on Poisson, Stokes, and Navier\u2013Stokes problems, achieving order-of-magnitude speedups with percent-level accuracy. See also: ScaleUpROM examples . 2. Component-Wise Reduced Order Models for Design and Optimization Component-wise ROMs represent an early and foundational instantiation of DD-FEM. In these methods, reduced operators are learned on reusable components and assembled to form global systems. Representative applications include: - Lattice-type structure design optimization - Compliance minimization and stress-constrained topology optimization - Static condensation-based assembly These methods demonstrate: - reusable offline training across many design instances, - up to 1000\u00d7 speedup over full FEM, - rigorous error bounds and sensitivity analysis. See: - Component-wise ROM lattice optimization - Stress-constrained topology optimization with component ROMs 3. DD-LSPG: Nonlinear Algebraic DD-FEM DD-LSPG extends DD-FEM to nonlinear systems using least-squares Petrov\u2013Galerkin projection at the subdomain level. Distinctive features: - algebraic (not geometric) domain decomposition, - independent local bases for interior and interfaces, - strong or weak compatibility enforcement, - a priori and a posteriori error bounds. This realization shows that DD-FEM applies beyond linear PDEs and FEM-style weak forms. Reference: - Domain-decomposition LSPG ROMs 4. Nonlinear-Manifold DD-FEM (DD-NM-ROM) DD-FEM also supports nonlinear manifold representations , where local bases are replaced by learned nonlinear maps (e.g., autoencoders). In DD-NM-ROM: - nonlinear manifolds are trained independently on subdomains, - coupling is enforced through algebraic DD constraints, - training cost scales with component size, not global size, - hyper-reduction enables efficient nonlinear evaluation. These methods demonstrate: - superior accuracy for problems with slow Kolmogorov n-width decay, - stable extrapolation from small to large domains, - strong theoretical guarantees.

In this sense, FEM and FVM already embody many of the characteristics now associated with \u201cfoundation models\u201d: generality, reusability, scalability, and scientific rigor. Our definition of foundation models for computational science builds directly on these principles. Rather than viewing foundation models as purely data-driven artifacts, we frame them as architectural frameworks that integrate learning into the same local-to-global, physics-constrained structure that has made FEM and FVM foundational to scientific computing.","title":"Inspiration from Classical Foundational Methods"},{"location":"foundation_models.html#challenges-of-building-foundation-models-in-computational-science","text":"Developing foundatin models in computational science is fundamentally harder than in natural language processing or vision.

In contrast, a single high-fidelity scientific simulation snapshot can contain millions to trillions of degrees of freedom.

Changes in mesh resolution, element type, topology, or geometry can invalidate naive generalization because many learned models are tied to a fixed discretization. Crucially, this dependence also forces expensive fine-tuning : as geometry or mesh changes, reuse of a monolithic model is often impossible, making large-scale retraining (or heavy fine-tuning) unavoidable.

Capturing long-time dynamics and multi-scale interactions in a single model \u2014 especially without retraining \u2014 remains a critical open challenge. These challenges suggest that foundation models in computational science cannot be constructed as purely data-driven, end-to-end surrogates.

The numerical results can be found in Poisson Problem . libROM assumes that you have a physics code, such as MFEM , SU2 , and Laghos . Then, libROM can be integrated into the physics code to build ROM to accelerate physics simulation. For example, see numerical results in Examples and Gallery . This tutorial illustrates how various libROM objects and functions can be used to collect simulation data, build reduced basis, and construct reduced order model operator to accelerate and predict a target physics simulation. The following tutorials are available: Tutorial 1 : offline , Take and write simulation data with libROM. Tutorial 2 : merge , Collect simulation data and build a reduced basis. Tutorial 3 : online , Build a ROM operator, solve the ROM system, and restore the full order state. Building Follow the building page to build the libROM library. You must build it with -m option to build MFEM library together. ~/libROM> ./scripts/compile.sh -m Tutorial 1 This tutorial demonstrates how to collect simulation data with libROM. The important object is BasisGenerator , which collects simulation data and computes reduced basis, using various singular value decomposition ( SVD ) algorithms, e.g., incremental SVD and static SVD . The incremental SVD is useful for time-dependent problems. Because the Poisson problem is a time-independent problem, we will focus on the usage of the static SVD. The definition of BasisGenerator class can be found in BasisGenerator.h . You must include BasisGenerator.h in your physics code where the simulation data is generated. For example, BasisGenerator.h is included in Line 32 of poisson_global_rom.cpp for Poisson Problem . #include \"BasisGenerator.h\" A BasisGenerator pointer is defined in Line 234 of poisson_global_rom.cpp and the pointer is initiated in Line 243 of poisson_global_rom.cpp . The BasisGenerator requires four inputs to initialize, i.e., Options , boolean variable, string, and Database::formats. The object, Options, sets various options for the BasisGenerator, such as the basis dimension and singular value tolerance. The boolean variable determines if the incremental or static SVD will be used. For this tutorial, we choose the static SVD, so the boolean variable must be false. Finally, the string input specifies the name of the basis file and Database::formats specifies the file format for the basis file. The default format is Database::HDF5. The detailed description for inputs for Options and BasisGenerator can be found in Options.h and BasisGenerator.h . The specific inputs used for the Poisson problem can be found in Lines 227--232 of poisson_global_rom.cpp . Now, the instantiated BasisGenerator, i.e., generator , collects the simulation data once it is available. The Poisson problem generates the solution, $X$, in Line 338 of poisson_global_rom.cpp and it is collected in the generator in Line 345 of poisson_global_rom.cpp . The member function, writeSnapshot on Line 346 of poisson_global_rom.cpp simply writes the solution data in the specified HDF5 file. Make sure that the pointers, generator and options , are deleted after done with sampling. This completes the libROM data collection implementation, which corresponds to the offline phase in the Poisson problem . If you execute the following command: poisson_global_rom -offline -f 1.0 -id 0 then you should see the HDF5 snapshot output file, i.e., basis0_snapshot.000000 . The command line options above include -offline that indicates the offline phase, -f 1.0 sets the frequency variable $\\kappa=1.0$ (see the Poisson problem for the description of the frequency variable), and -id 0 labels the snapshot index. The visualization of the solution can be done either with VisIt or GLVis. For example, the VisIt shows the following solution contour for this specific simulation: Please execute the following commands: poisson_global_rom -offline -f 1.1 -id 1 poisson_global_rom -offline -f 1.2 -id 2 whose solution contour corresponds, respectively, to: Tutorial 2 Once the simulation data are collected within libROM basis files, they can be merged to form a reduced basis. This process is called the merge phase . It is implemented in Lines 249--270 of poisson_global_rom.cpp . As in Tutorial 1 , the objects, Options and BasisGenerator must be defined (see Lines 251--253 of poisson_global_rom.cpp . The generator iterates over the individual HDF5 snapshot file and loads them all (see Lines 254--259 of poisson_global_rom.cpp . The member function endSamples in Line 260 of poisson_global_rom.cpp computes the reduced basis. Again make sure to delete the pointers, i.e., generator and options . For exammple, the following command line option runs the merge phase: poisson_global_rom -merge -ns 3 The command line option, -merge , invokes the merges phase and -ns 3 option indicates that there are three different snapshot files. The merge phase reads the three snapshot files, i.e., basis0_snapshot.000000 , basis1_snapshot.000000 , and basis2_snapshot.000000 , which were generated in Tutorial 1 , and forms a reduced basis and stores it in the HDF5 basis file, i.e., basis.000000 . Tutorial 3 The online phase builds ROM operators, solves the ROM system, and restores the full order states for a new parameter value. This tutorial demonstrates these three different actions for the frequency value, $\\kappa = 1.15$. Lines 356--357 of poisson_global_rom.cpp implements the step of reading a basis file. The BasisReader object reads the basis file, using member function, getSpatialBasis , which returns a Matrix object in libROM. The number of rows and columns of the reduced basis can be obtained through the member functions of the Matrix class, i.e., numRows and numColumns , respectively. Line 364 of poisson_global_rom.cpp defines a MFEM DenseMatrix that holds the transpose of the reduced basis matrix. This must be understood as the transpose because libROM stores the matrix row-wise. The MFEM matrix is defined to form a reduced system operator, whose process is implemented in Lines 368--375 of poisson_global_rom.cpp . Then the reduced system operator is inverted at Line 370 of poisson_global_rom.cpp . The reduced right-hand-side is formed by multiplying the reduced basis transpose to the full order model right-hand-side vector, $B$ at Line 374 of poisson_global_rom.cpp . Line 380 of poisson_global_rom.cpp solves the reduced system of equation. Line 384 of poisson_global_rom.cpp restores the corresponding full order state by multipling the reduced solution by the reduced basis. The command line options that executes the online phase described above are poisson_global_rom -online -f 1.15 where -online option invokes the online phase and -f 1.15 sets the frequency value $\\kappa = 1.15$. This particular example ROM accelerates the physics simulation by $7.5$ and achieves the relative error, $6.4e-4$, with respect to the corresponding full order model solution.","title":"Poisson equation"},{"location":"poisson.html#poisson-equation","text":"The main code for this tutorial can be found in poisson_global_rom.cpp , which accelerates the Poisson problem $$-\\Delta u = f$$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.

For the recap, the general procedure of the greedy algorithm follows: Define a parameter space Pick an initial point in the parameter space to build a ROM there (a good cancidiate initla point is either the centroid or one of end points) Evaluate error indicator of the current ROM (either global or local ROM) at $N$ random points within the parameter space Check if the maximum error indicator value is less than the desirable accuracy threshold If the answer to Step 4 is yes, then terminate the greedy process. If the answer to Step 4 is no, then collect the full order model simulation data at the maximum error indicator point and add them to update the ROM Go to Step 3. As in the Poisson equation tutorial , we choose to vary the frequency $\\kappa$ as parameter. First, we define the parameter space to be from $0.5$ to $3$, which is larger than the one used in Poisson equation tutorial . You can try the following command line options to run the greedy procedure: ./poisson_local_rom_greedy -build_database -greedy-param-min 0.5 -greedy-param-max 3 -greedy-param-size 40 -greedysubsize 10 -greedyconvsize 20 -greedyrelerrortol 0.01 The lower and upper bounds of the parameter are determined by the options, -greedy-param-min and -greedy-param-max , respectively. The option -greedy-param-size specifies the total number of random sample points within the parameter space for the whole greedy procedure. The option -greedysubsize sets the number of sub-sample points, where the error indicator is evaluated at every greedy iterations. The option -greedyconvsize sets the number of convergence-sample points on which the error indicator is checked and the termination of the greedy algorithm is determined if the error indicators are below the convergence threshold after the error indicator tests on the sub-sample points have been passed. Finally, -greedyrelerrortol sets the desirable relative error for the greedy algorithm to achieve. The core class of the libROM for the greedy procedure is GreedySampler , which is defined on Line 126 of poisson_local_rom_greedy.cpp The GreedySampler generates sampling points within a given parameter space. The class has two sub-classes, i.e., GreedyCustomSampler and GreedyRandomSampler . The GreedyCustomSampler generates pre-defined sampling points, e.g., a tensor product sampling points, while the GreedyRandomSampler generates random sampling points, e.g., Latin hyper-cube sampling points. The GreedySampler also does book-keeping job of at which sampling point to evaluate the error indicator, when to move onto the next greedy step, and which sampling point has the maximum error indicator value. Just to be clear, the libROM does not do everything for you. For example, the error indicator must be defined in the physics solver. For the Poisson example, the residual-based error indicator is defined at Lines 529-535 of poisson_loca_rom_greedy.cpp . Once the greedy procedure completes, the log file, called poisson_greedy_algorithm_log.txt , is generated to show the progress of the greedy procedure and the final parameter points on which the global ROM was built.

ScaleupROM is a projection-based reduced order model code with discontinuous Galerkin domain decomposition (DG-DD) using libROM and MFEM. It aims to create a robust and efficient large-scale ROM that is trained only from small scale component samples which can be used to solve a variety of physics PDEs. For more information, refer to the ScaleupROM repo and online wiki . Select from the categories below to display examples that contain the respective feature. All examples support (arbitrarily) high-order meshes and finite element spaces . The numerical results from the example codes can be visualized using the GLVis or VisIt visualization tools.

Application (PDE) All Stokes flow Reduced order model type All pROM Assembly All Discontinuous Galerkin Hyper-reduction All No hyper-reduction Physics code All MFEM Stokes flow This example demonstrates the use of ScaleupROM to create a reduced order model for the Stokes flow problem discretized using Taylor-Hood elements. The governing equation for Stokes flow is defined as $$ - \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{\\tilde{u}} + \\nabla \\mathit{\\widetilde{p}} = 0 $$ $$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{\\tilde{u}} = 0 $$ with boundary conditions $$ \\mathbf{\\tilde{u}} = \\mathbf{g}_{di} $$ $$ \\mathbf{n} \\cdot ( - \\nu \\nabla \\mathbf{\\tilde{u}} + \\mathit{\\widetilde{p}} \\mathbf{I}) = \\mathbf{g}_{ne} $$ where $\\mathbf{u}$ and $p$ denote the velocity and pressure field respectively, and $\\nu \\equiv \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_0} = 1.1$ is the non-dimensionalized dynamic viscosity with respect to a reference value. The global-scale system is constructed using a random arrangement from five different reference components: empty, circle, triangle, square, and star. In this example, the fluid flows past an array of these components. Sample snapshots for basis training are generated on 2x2 component domains to better capture downstream flow. A total of 1400 sample snapshots were taken for this example. On each sample domain, the inflow velocity Dirichlet boundary condition is parameterized as $$ \\mathbf{g}_{di} = (g_1 + \\Delta g_1 \\sin 2\\pi (\\mathbf{k}_1 \\cdot x + \\theta_1),\\ g_2 + \\Delta g_2 \\sin 2\\pi (\\mathbf{k}_2 \\cdot x + \\theta_2)) $$ where the parameters are chosen from a uniform random distribution, $$ g_1, g_2 \\sim U[-1, 1] $$ $$ \\Delta g_1, \\Delta g_2 \\sim U[-0.1, 0.1] $$ $$ \\mathbf{k}_1, \\mathbf{k}_2 \\sim U[-0.5, 0.5]^2 $$ $$ \\theta_1, \\theta_2 \\sim U[0, 1] $$ Boundaries at the surface of the object inside the domain have a no-slip wall boundary $g_{di} = 0$ and boundaries on interior interfaces have a homogeneous Neumann boundary $g_{ne} = 0$. The figure above shows the ROM prediction for $\\mathbf{u}$ on a 8x8 system composed of random components with parameter values $g_1 = 1.5, g_2 = -0.8, \\Delta g_1 = \\Delta g_2 = 0$.
