<h1 id="foundation-models-for-computational-science">Foundation Models for Computational Science</h1>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision by enabling reusable, adaptable models that generalize across tasks and
domains. Achieving an analogous capability in computational science is far more
challenging due to the diversity of governing equations, geometries, physical
regimes, and discretizations.</p>
<p>libROM team addresses this challenge through the <strong>Data-Driven Finite Element Method
(DD-FEM)</strong> — a <em>general architectural framework</em> that combines data-driven local
modeling with classical finite-element-style global assembly. Importantly,
DD-FEM is not a conceptual proposal: it has been <strong>realized in multiple
production-quality algorithms</strong>, each demonstrated through published numerical
examples.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-is-a-foundation-model-in-computational-science">What Is a Foundation Model in Computational Science?</h2>
<p>In computational science, a foundation model must satisfy requirements beyond
those in data-centric ML fields. In particular, it must:</p>
<ul>
<li>generalize across <em>geometries, domains, and boundary conditions</em>,</li>
<li>be reusable without retraining for every new global configuration,</li>
<li>enforce governing equations and physical constraints explicitly,</li>
<li>scale to large systems using data from smaller subsystems,</li>
<li>admit mathematical analysis (stability, error bounds, convergence).</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">

</p>

<h3 id="inspiration-from-classical-foundational-methods">Inspiration from Classical Foundational Methods</h3>
<p>Our definition of a foundation model for computational science is intentionally
inspired by <strong>classical foundation methods</strong> that have underpinned scientific
computing for decades, most notably the <strong>finite element method (FEM)</strong> and the
<strong>finite volume method (FVM)</strong>.</p>
<p>These methods are considered foundational not because they solve a single
problem optimally, but because they provide a <strong>general, reusable, and
composable framework</strong> applicable across a broad range of governing equations,
geometries, and physical regimes. FEM and FVM achieve this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>local representations that are independent of global problem size,</li>
<li>systematic assembly into large-scale global systems,</li>
<li>explicit enforcement of conservation laws and governing equations,</li>
<li>extensibility across domains without redesigning the core methodology.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this sense, FEM and FVM already embody many of the characteristics now
associated with “foundation models”: generality, reusability, scalability, and
scientific rigor.</p>
<p>Our definition of foundation models for computational science builds directly on
these principles. Rather than viewing foundation models as purely data-driven
artifacts, we frame them as <strong>architectural frameworks</strong> that integrate learning
into the same local-to-global, physics-constrained structure that has made FEM
and FVM foundational to scientific computing.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="challenges-of-building-foundation-models-in-computational-science">Challenges of Building Foundation Models in Computational Science</h2>
<p>Developing foundatin models in computational science is fundamentally harder
than in natural language processing or vision. The <em>Defining Foundation Models
for Computational Science</em> position paper [1] outlines several structural obstacles
that must be addressed before truly general, reusable scientific foundation
models can be achieved. </p>
<h3 id="massive-data-point-size"><strong>Massive Data Point Size</strong></h3>
<p>In NLP or computer vision, individual data points (tokens, image patches) are
small and easily batched for training. In contrast, a single high-fidelity
scientific simulation snapshot can contain millions to trillions of degrees of
freedom. This:</p>
<ul>
<li>creates huge memory and compute burdens,</li>
<li>limits batch sizes,</li>
<li>slows convergence of training, and</li>
<li>makes overfitting more likely with limited data. </li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/Challenge2.png" width="65%" alt="The image describing the massive data point size in computational science.">
</p>

<h3 id="expensive-fine-tuning-across-tasks"><strong>Expensive Fine-Tuning Across Tasks</strong></h3>
<p>Foundation models should adapt to new tasks with minimal additional training.
In computational science, however, downstream problems frequently differ in PDE
type, geometry, mesh resolution, boundary conditions, or time-dependent
behavior. Fine-tuning on such distinct tasks can be computationally expensive,
undermining reusability and scalability. </p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/ExpensiveFineTuning2.png" width="95%" alt="The image describing expensive fine tuning">
</p>

<h3 id="data-heterogeneity"><strong>Data Heterogeneity</strong></h3>
<p>Scientific systems involve a wide range of data types (scalars, vectors,
tensors), multi-physics couplings, and time dependencies. Designing a single
architecture that meaningfully integrates such heterogeneous data across
domains is an open research challenge. </p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/DataHeterogeneity2.png" width="95%" alt="The image describing data heterogeneity">
</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-standardized-datasets"><strong>Lack of Standardized Datasets</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike NLP and vision, large standardized datasets covering multiple physics
domains do not exist. The absence of shared, high-quality datasets hampers
large-scale pretraining and makes it hard to benchmark and compare scientific
foundation models. </p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/LackOfStandardizedDatasets2.png" width="95%" alt="The image describing the lack of standardized datasets">
</p>

<h3 id="mesh-and-geometry-dependence"><strong>Mesh and Geometry Dependence</strong></h3>
<p>Scientific simulations depend intrinsically on the computational mesh and domain
geometry. Changes in mesh resolution, element type, topology, or geometry can
invalidate naive generalization because many learned models are tied to a fixed
discretization.</p>
<p>Crucially, this dependence also <strong>forces expensive fine-tuning</strong>: as geometry or mesh
changes, reuse of a monolithic model is often impossible, making large-scale retraining
(or heavy fine-tuning) unavoidable. This breaks scalability and undermines the
reusability expected of foundation models.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/GeometryDependence.png" width="95%" alt="The image describing the challenge of geometry dependence">
</p>

<h3 id="physics-informed-constraints"><strong>Physics-Informed Constraints</strong></h3>
<p>Scientific systems obey conservation laws, symmetries, and boundary conditions.
Enforcing these constraints in learned models without degrading generality is a
major open problem. Many ML models either ignore physical laws or hard-code
specific physics, limiting flexibility. </p>
<h3 id="trust-interpretability-and-scientific-validity"><strong>Trust, Interpretability, and Scientific Validity</strong></h3>
<p>For adoption in engineering and science, models must be interpretable,
verifiable, and physically consistent. Black-box neural models that violate
conservation or produce nonphysical results are difficult to trust in
high-stakes applications. </p>
<h3 id="multiscale-and-long-time-behavior"><strong>Multiscale and Long-Time Behavior</strong></h3>
<p>Real scientific systems often involve multiple spatial and temporal scales
(e.g., turbulence, fracture, phase change). Capturing long-time dynamics and
multi-scale interactions in a single model — especially without retraining —
remains a critical open challenge. </p>
<hr />
<p>These challenges suggest that foundation models in computational science cannot
be constructed as purely data-driven, end-to-end surrogates. Instead, they
require an architectural framework that integrates learning with classical
numerical structure, supports local training with global reuse, and preserves
scientific rigor.</p>
<p>The <strong>Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM)</strong> provides such a framework.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-data-driven-finite-element-method-dd-fem">The Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM)</h2>
<h3 id="core-principle">Core Principle</h3>
<p>DD-FEM replaces classical finite-element shape functions with <strong>learned local
models</strong> trained on component-level data, while retaining:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Local training</strong> on small subdomains or components  </li>
<li><strong>Global assembly</strong> via domain decomposition or finite-element-style coupling  </li>
<li><strong>Explicit solution of governing equations</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Reuse of pretrained components</strong> across unseen global systems  </li>
</ol>
<p>This mirrors the role of basis functions in FEM, but with learned representations
that can capture multiscale, nonlinear, and parameterized physics more
efficiently.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="implemented-dd-fem-realizations-through-librom-open-source-codes">Implemented DD-FEM Realizations through libROM open source codes</h2>
<p>DD-FEM is a <em>framework</em>, not a single algorithm. libROM contains multiple,
independently developed realizations that instantiate this framework in
different settings.</p>
<h3 id="1-scaleuprom-projection-based-dd-fem-with-dg-assembly">1. ScaleUpROM: Projection-Based DD-FEM with DG Assembly</h3>
<p><strong>ScaleUpROM</strong> is a DD-FEM realization using projection-based reduced order
models coupled through <strong>discontinuous Galerkin domain decomposition (DG-DD)</strong>.</p>
<p>Key characteristics:
- Local ROMs trained only on small components
- Global systems assembled without retraining
- Robust spatial extrapolation (“train small, model big”)
- Physics-constrained solves at all scales</p>
<p>ScaleUpROM has been demonstrated on Poisson, Stokes, and Navier–Stokes problems,
achieving order-of-magnitude speedups with percent-level accuracy.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="scaleup.html">ScaleUpROM examples</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-component-wise-reduced-order-models-for-design-and-optimization">2. Component-Wise Reduced Order Models for Design and Optimization</h3>
<p>Component-wise ROMs represent an early and foundational instantiation of DD-FEM.
In these methods, reduced operators are learned on reusable components and
assembled to form global systems.</p>
<p>Representative applications include:
- Lattice-type structure design optimization
- Compliance minimization and stress-constrained topology optimization
- Static condensation-based assembly</p>
<p>These methods demonstrate:
- reusable offline training across many design instances,
- up to <strong>1000× speedup</strong> over full FEM,
- rigorous error bounds and sensitivity analysis.</p>
<p>See:
- Component-wise ROM lattice optimization 
- Stress-constrained topology optimization with component ROMs </p>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-dd-lspg-nonlinear-algebraic-dd-fem">3. DD-LSPG: Nonlinear Algebraic DD-FEM</h3>
<p>DD-LSPG extends DD-FEM to <strong>nonlinear systems</strong> using least-squares
Petrov–Galerkin projection at the subdomain level.</p>
<p>Distinctive features:
- algebraic (not geometric) domain decomposition,
- independent local bases for interior and interfaces,
- strong or weak compatibility enforcement,
- a priori and a posteriori error bounds.</p>
<p>This realization shows that DD-FEM applies beyond linear PDEs and FEM-style
weak forms.</p>

- Domain-decomposition LSPG ROMs </p>
<hr />
<h3 id="4-nonlinear-manifold-dd-fem-dd-nm-rom">4. Nonlinear-Manifold DD-FEM (DD-NM-ROM)</h3>
<p>DD-FEM also supports <strong>nonlinear manifold representations</strong>, where local bases
are replaced by learned nonlinear maps (e.g., autoencoders).</p>
<p>In DD-NM-ROM:
- nonlinear manifolds are trained independently on subdomains,
- coupling is enforced through algebraic DD constraints,
- training cost scales with component size, not global size,
- hyper-reduction enables efficient nonlinear evaluation.</p>
<p>These methods demonstrate:
- superior accuracy for problems with slow Kolmogorov n-width decay,

<h2 id="why-dd-fem-qualifies-as-a-foundation-model-framework">Why DD-FEM Qualifies as a Foundation-Model Framework</h2>
<p>Across all realizations, DD-FEM exhibits the defining traits of foundation
models in computational science:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reusability</strong>: pretrained components apply across many global systems  </li>
<li><strong>Generalization</strong>: extrapolation in domain size, geometry, and configuration  </li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: training cost decoupled from global problem size  </li>
<li><strong>Scientific rigor</strong>: governing equations enforced explicitly  </li>
<li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: linear, nonlinear, projection-based, and manifold-based models  </li>
</ul>
<p>DD-FEM plays the same foundational role for data-driven simulation that FEM
plays for classical numerical analysis.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="dd-fem-in-librom">DD-FEM in libROM</h2>
<p>libROM open-source codes serve as an <strong>open research platform</strong> for DD-FEM, supporting:</p>
<ul>
<li>component-level training workflows,</li>
<li>multiple assembly strategies (DG, static condensation, residual minimization),</li>
<li>linear and nonlinear reduced representations,</li>
<li>integration with MFEM and large-scale HPC solvers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Concrete numerical demonstrations are available throughout the
<a href="examples.html">Examples</a> and <a href="scaleup.html">ScaleUpROM</a> pages.</p>
